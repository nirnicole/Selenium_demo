# Selenium_demo

notes:
1. you must specify your preferred web browser and supply a path to its driver on you computer.
2. the test will work both on minimized and a full screen.
3. test results will be display at runtime on console as booleans, you can add them to a final report if needed.
4. i tried my best to keep it simple while addressing majore plots such as the expanding menu dependency, note that theres a lot more to do.
5. the code uses timouts with sleep for display (and delay) purposes.
